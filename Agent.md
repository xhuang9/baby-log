# Repository Guidelines

## Project Context
Start with `CLAUDE.md`. It is the source of truth for architecture, commands, and conventions. This document intentionally summarizes only the essentials and points you to `CLAUDE.md` for details and rationale.

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- App code: `src/` (Next.js App Router with locale routing under `src/app/[locale]/`).
- Shared libraries: `src/libs/` (centralized third-party configs).
- Components/templates: `src/components/`, `src/templates/`.
- Locales: `src/locales/` (translation JSON files).
- Tests: unit tests are colocated in `src/`; E2E and integration tests live in `tests/`.
- Migrations: `migrations/` generated by Drizzle.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Refer to `CLAUDE.md` for the complete command list. Common examples:
- `npm run dev` starts local development with DB migration.
- `npm run build` creates a production build.
- `npm run test` runs Vitest.
- `npm run test:e2e` runs Playwright.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript-first; keep types explicit and avoid `any`.
- Use the `@/` path alias for imports from `src/`.
- Linting is enforced with ESLint (`npm run lint`). Format changes should follow existing file style.

## Testing Guidelines
- Unit tests: colocated (`*.test.{ts,tsx}`) run via `npm run test`.
- E2E tests: `tests/` with Playwright (`npm run test:e2e`).
- Keep test data deterministic and prefer minimal fixtures.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Conventional commits are expected (see `commitlint.config.ts`). Use `npm run commit` if needed.
- PRs should include a clear description, relevant links, and screenshots for UI changes.

## Configuration & Security Notes
- Environment variables are validated in `src/libs/Env.ts`. Do not commit secrets.
- Crowdin, Sentry, Clerk, and DB setup details are documented in `CLAUDE.md`.
